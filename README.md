# How to start coding:

1. Clone the repo to your local computer

```bash
git clone <URL>
```

2. cd into the folder with the activity you want

```bash
cd session-3
```

3. Open up a code editor of your choice, get to coding, and build the program
with the following command:

```bash
./run activity_name
```

# Having trouble getting the latest activities?

Try running the helper script to pull changes to your local machine while
ignoring merge conflicts

```bash
chmod +x git_reset.sh
./git_reset.sh
```

> [!WARNING]
> Incase you have code/activities in this repo you want to save, you should make a copy of those before running this script, just incase. It's designed to save your local changes, but it isn't perfect.
